**ABSTRACT**

Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis and monitoring often use dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging with single-
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This study investigated the lateralization of brain dopamine
function and the potential of DATSCAN as a reliable biomarker for PD diagnosis. Utilizing data from the Parkinson’s
Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the Striatal Binding Ratio (SBR) values in the Caudate and Putamen regions
of both Healthy Controls (HC) and PD patients were analyzed to extract a Lateralization Index metric. Significant
lateralization was observed in the Putamen region of PD patients, indicating asymmetric dopaminergic
degeneration. Genetics was identified as a significant factor influencing lateralization in the Putamen region of PD
patients. Symptom-related variables also appear to be correlated with the Lateralization Index. A machine
learning model was developed, successfully predicting PD diagnosis based on the Putamen's Lateralization Index,
confirming both the literature results and the findings of this study and demonstrating the potential of this metric
as a diagnostic tool. These findings highlight the importance of understanding dopaminergic asymmetry in PD
progression and the potential application of DATSCAN in clinical diagnostics as an asymmetry biomarker. Future
research should focus on validating these results in more heterogeneous cohorts and exploring the mechanisms
behind lateralization to enhance early diagnosis.
